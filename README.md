pymovements is an open-source python package for processing eye movement data. It provides a simple
interface to download publicly available datasets, preprocess gaze data, detect oculomotoric events
and render plots to visually analyze your results.

## Installation

pymovements can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pymovements) via pip:

```bash
pip install pymovements
```

or from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pymovements):

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pymovements
```

For other options, including uv and installing from source for development, see the
[installation guide](https://pymovements.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started/installation.html).

## Getting Started

If you are new to pymovements or to eye-tracking data analysis, we recommend starting with the **User Guide**, which introduces the concepts, data
structures, and workflows used throughout the library: 👉 [User Guide](https://pymovements.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/index.html)


### Quick example

For a minimal example of loading and processing eye-tracking data with pymovements:

```python
import pymovements as pm

dataset = pm.Dataset(
    'JuDo1000',  # choose a public dataset from our dataset library
    path='data/judo100',  # setup your local dataset path
)
dataset.download()  # download a public dataset from our dataset library
dataset.load()  # load the dataset
```

Transform coordinates and calculate velocities:

```python
dataset.pix2deg()  # transform pixel coordinates to degrees of visual angle
dataset.pos2vel()  # transform positional data to velocity data
```

Detect oculomotoric events:

```python
dataset.detect('ivt')  # detect fixation using the I-VT algorithm
dataset.detect('microsaccades')  # detect saccades using the microsaccades algorithm
```

<!-- With pymovements loading your eye movement [datasets](https://pymovements.readthedocs.io/en/stable/datasets/index.html) is just a few lines of code away -->

## Use of Generative AI

Generative AI tools are used, under human direction, in the development and maintenance of
pymovements. Anthropic's Claude, JetBrains' Junie, and GitHub Copilot assist some contributors
and maintainers with tasks such as code generation, drafting tests and documentation, and code
review.

Every change to the codebase requires an approving review from at least one maintainer before
merging, and the maintainer team takes responsibility for the correctness and quality of all code
and documentation in this package.

## Citing
