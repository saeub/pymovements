    Parameters
    ----------
    line_ys: pl.Series | Sequence[float]
        Vertical y-coordinates (midlines) of lines of text.
    y_thresh: float
        Vertical distance threshold for sequence splitting. (default: 32)
    g_thresh: float
        Gradient constraint for sequence merging. (default: 0.1)
    e_thresh: float
        Error constraint for sequence merging. (default: 20)
    directionality: str
        Reading direction of the text, either 'left-to-right' or 'right-to-left',
        mirroring the directionality of a text stimulus writing system. For
        'right-to-left' the return sweep detection is adjusted accordingly.
        (default: 'left-to-right')
    location: str | pl.Expr
        Column name or expression of [x, y] fixation locations. The returned expression
        operates on the full fixation sequence of a single trial, so it must be evaluated
        per trial. (default: 'location')

    Returns
    -------
    pl.Expr
        Expression computing the corrected y-coordinates.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the directionality is 'top-to-bottom' or not a known value.
