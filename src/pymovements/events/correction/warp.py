    Parameters
    ----------
    word_locations: pl.Series
        Series of [x, y] word center coordinates, where y is the line position of the
        word's line.
    location: str | pl.Expr
        Column name or expression of [x, y] fixation locations. The returned expression
        operates on the full fixation sequence of a single trial, so it must be evaluated
        per trial. (default: 'location')

    Returns
    -------
    pl.Expr
        Expression computing the corrected y-coordinates.
