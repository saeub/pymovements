    Parameters
    ----------
    events: Events
        The already detected events.
    timesteps: list[int] | numpy.ndarray | polars.Series
        shape (N, )
        Continuous 1D timestep time series. Each event covers the half-open interval
        ``[onset, offset)``; the event ``onset`` and ``offset`` values must be in the same
        unit as ``timesteps``. When ``events`` stores ``polars.Duration`` on- and offsets,
        ``timesteps`` are expected to be in milliseconds.
    minimum_duration: int
        Minimum fixation duration. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``.
        (default: 1)
    name: str
        Name for detected events in Events. (default: 'unclassified')

    Returns
    -------
    Events
        A dataframe with detected fixations as rows.
