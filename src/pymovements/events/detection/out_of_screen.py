    """Detect gaze samples with pixel coordinates outside of screen boundaries.

    The algorithm classifies each gaze sample as out-of-screen if the x or y pixel coordinate
    falls outside the given screen boundaries. Consecutive out-of-screen samples are merged
    into single events.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels: list[list[float]] | list[tuple[float, float]] | numpy.ndarray | polars.Series
        shape (N, 2)
        Continuous 2D pixel coordinate time series. The first column is the x coordinate
        and the second column is the y coordinate.
    x_max: float
        Maximum valid x pixel coordinate (exclusive). For a 1920px wide screen, set to 1920.
    y_max: float
        Maximum valid y pixel coordinate (exclusive). For a 1080px tall screen, set to 1080.
    x_min: float
        Minimum valid x pixel coordinate (inclusive). (default: 0)
    y_min: float
        Minimum valid y pixel coordinate (inclusive). (default: 0)
    timesteps: list[int] | numpy.ndarray | polars.Series | None
        shape (N, )
        Corresponding continuous 1D timestep time series. If None, sample based timesteps are
        assumed. (default: None)
    name: str
        Name for detected events in Events. (default: 'out_of_screen')

    Returns
    -------
    Events
        A dataframe with detected out-of-screen events as rows.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If pixels is a polars Series and dtype not List
    ValueError
        If pixels is None or does not have shape (N, 2).
        If x_min >= x_max.
        If y_min >= y_max.
