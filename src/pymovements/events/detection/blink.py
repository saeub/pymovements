    """Detect blinks from the pupil signal.

    The blink detection algorithm consists of three main stages. The implementation is inspired by
    :cite:p:`PupilPre`, which adapts the velocity-based method described in :cite:p:`Hershman2018`.

    **Stage 1 — Flag pupil loss:** All samples where the pupil value is NaN or zero (common
    blink indicators in eye-tracking data) are candidate_mask as blink candidates.

    **Stage 2 — Flag abrupt pupil changes:**: Each sample i+1 is masked as blink candidate if the
    absolute difference between consecutive pupil samples i, i+1 exceeds a ``delta`` threshold.
    If ``delta`` is ``None``, it is automatically estimated as 5 times the 95th percentile of valid
    absolute differences (non-zero, not NaN) .

    **Stage 3 — Combine blink candidates:** Combine consecutive blinks with a time gap lower than
    the specified ``minimum_gap``. Blinks are only combined if the candidates before and after the
    short gap have a ``minimum_candidate_duration_to_absorb_gap``.

    Blink events shorter than ``minimum_duration`` and longer than ``maximum_duration`` are
    discarded. Following :cite:p:`Nystrom2024` typical blinks last 50–500 ms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pupil: list[float] | numpy.ndarray | polars.Series
        shape (N,)
        Continuous 1D pupil size time series (e.g., diameter or area).
    timesteps: list[int] | numpy.ndarray | polars.Series | None
        shape (N,)
        Corresponding continuous 1D timestep time series. If None, sample-based timesteps are
        assumed.
        (default: None)
    delta: float | None
        Threshold on absolute pupil difference for flagging rapid changes. If None, it is
        auto-estimated as ``5 * numpy.nanpercentile(abs_diff, 95)`` from valid absolute
        differences.
        (default: None)
    minimum_duration: int
        Minimum blink duration. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``;
        for a ``polars.Duration`` timesteps series the unit is milliseconds. If ``timesteps`` is
        None, then ``minimum_duration`` is specified in numbers of samples.
        (default: 50)
    maximum_duration: int | None
        Maximum blink duration. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``;
        for a ``polars.Duration`` timesteps series the unit is milliseconds. If ``timesteps`` is
        None, then ``maximum_duration`` is specified in numbers of samples.
        Set to None to disable the upper bound.
        (default: 500)
    minimum_gap: int
        Minimum time gap in-between two blinks. Blinks that have a smaller time gap are combined
        into a single event. The duration is specified in the units used in ``timesteps``; for a
        ``polars.Duration`` timesteps series the unit is milliseconds. If ``timesteps`` is None,
        then ``minimum_gap`` is specified in numbers of samples.
        (default: 100)
    minimum_candidates_around_gap: tuple[int, int] | int
        Minimum number of candidate samples required on each side of a gap for it to be absorbed. If
        a tuple is provided the values are used for the number of left and right candidates
        respectively. If an integer is provided the number of candidate samples required is
        symmetric.
        (default: (2, 2))
    name: str
        Name for detected events in Events. (default: 'blink')

    Returns
    -------
    Events
        A dataframe with detected blink events as rows.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If minimum_candidate_duration_to_absorb_gap neither int nor tuple[int].
    ValueError
        If pupil is not 1D.
        If pupil and timesteps have different lengths.
        If delta is not positive.
        If minimum_duration is not positive.
        If maximum_duration is not positive or less than minimum_duration.
