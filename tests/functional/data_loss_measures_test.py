"""Test measure-based replacements for the removed data-loss metadata fields.

The ``data_loss_ratio`` and ``data_loss_ratio_blinks`` fields were removed from
the EyeLink parser metadata in favor of ``pymovements.measure.data_loss`` and
``Gaze.measure_events_ratio`` (see issue #1584).

    """Overlapping binocular blink events are merged by measure_events_ratio.

    Binocular recordings emit separate left-eye and right-eye blink events which
    typically overlap in time. ``measure_events_ratio`` merges overlapping
    intervals of the ``blink_eyelink`` events before summing durations, so the
    overlap is counted only once and the ratio cannot exceed 1.0.

    This matches the behavior of the removed ``data_loss_ratio_blinks`` metadata
    field, which merged overlapping blink intervals before counting and reported
    97 / 105 for this scenario (see issues #1584 and #1661).
