.. rubric:: Fixation Drift Correction
    :name: fixation-drift-correction

These functions can be used to apply a line-alignment correction algorithm to a set of fixations.
The algorithms will adjust the y-coordinates of the fixations to correct for drift and systematic
error in the eye-tracking data. This is particularly useful for paragraph reading data, where
y-alignment issues can lead to a fixation being assigned to the wrong line of text. Fixation
drift correction assumes reading data recorded on a
:py:class:`~pymovements.stimulus.TextStimulus`, whose areas of interest provide the text line
positions. Available
algorithms are listed under :ref:`Drift Correction Algorithms <drift-correction-algorithms>`.
The most convenient way to correct fixations is via the
:py:meth:`Events.correct_fixations` and
:py:meth:`Dataset.correct_fixations` methods.

.. rubric:: Drift Correction Algorithms
    :name: drift-correction-algorithms

The following algorithms can be used to apply a line-alignment correction algorithm to a set of
fixations. These algorithms, which are described in detail by Carr et al. :cite:p:`Carr2022`,
can be applied to the fixations using the
:func:`~pymovements.events.correction.correct_fixations` function. By default, the
:func:`~pymovements.events.correction.correct_fixations` function will use the
:func:`~pymovements.events.correction.wisdom_of_the_crowd` algorithm which is an
ensemble method that combines the results of the other algorithms to produce a more robust
correction. Each algorithm operates on the fixation sequence of a single trial and must be
applied per trial. The :func:`~pymovements.events.correction.correct_fixations` function and
the :py:meth:`Events.correct_fixations` method take care of this per-trial application.
