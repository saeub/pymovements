## TL;DR

Changes that many other things depend on (the data model, operation contracts, on-disk
formats, this process) require a PMEP: a design document in `docs/source/pmep/`, proposed
and decided in a pull request, with at least one active core contributor among its authors.
Acceptance needs a window of 14 days, 2 approvals from active core contributors other than
the author(s), and no unresolved objection. The lead maintainer may override objections but
not the approval floor. Core contributors are listed in `GOVERNANCE.md`. Everything else
keeps the usual issue and PR workflow.

This process exists so that the reasoning behind such decisions is written down once and can
be cited later instead of reconstructed from issue threads.

## What needs a proposal

A **PMEP** (pymovements Enhancement Proposal) is required only for changes that many other
things depend on:

- the data model: containers, slots, how recordings, events, stimuli and measures are represented
- contracts every operation or pipeline follows: operation contract, registry, column
  declarations, log format
- on-disk formats and layouts that published datasets depend on
- this process

Adding an attribute to an existing class needs a PMEP only if readers, writers or operations
must account for it, not if it is local to the class.

Everything else, including breaking changes to individual functions or classes, is an issue,
a pull request, a changelog entry, and the usual five-minor-release deprecation window.
When in doubt, open an issue. It graduates to a PMEP if the discussion shows it needs one.

## Where they live

`docs/source/pmep/pmep-NNN-short-title.md`, opened as a pull request and rendered in the
documentation. Every PMEP has at least one active core contributor among its authors. A pull
request opened without one becomes a PMEP if an active core contributor joins as co-author
within 14 days, and is otherwise closed, not merged. The number is assigned when the
authorship requirement is met, so the proposal can be cited by number during discussion.
The pull request stays open until the decision falls and merges carrying the final status.
Rejected and withdrawn PMEPs are merged too and stay in the repository as records of what
was considered and why not.

Status is one of: Draft · Accepted · Final (implemented) · Rejected · Withdrawn · Superseded.

## Who decides

**Core contributors** are listed in `GOVERNANCE.md`. Active core contributors have the right
to author PMEPs and to vote. Anyone else can author a PMEP by gaining an active core
contributor as co-author. Anyone may comment. The entry criterion, additions to the list
and the emeritus rule are defined in `GOVERNANCE.md`.

**The lead maintainer decides objections.** An unresolved objection may be overridden. The
override is written into the PMEP with reasoning and answers the objection on its merits.
The approval requirement below is a hard floor and cannot be overridden.

## How a PMEP is accepted

Votes are cast as GitHub reviews on the pull request: an approving review counts as an
approval, a request for changes as an objection. The acceptance window starts when the author
marks the pull request ready for review.

1. Open at least 14 days since the last substantive revision.
2. At least 2 approvals from active core contributors other than the author(s).
3. No unresolved objection.

An objection must state a technical reason concrete enough to be addressed. It does not have
to propose the fix. An objection without such a reason does not block.

An objection is resolved when withdrawn, when addressed in the text and not renewed within
7 days, or when overridden by the lead maintainer. After 30 days without quorum the author
pings the active core contributors. Nothing changes state automatically.

A PMEP may be discussed in a scheduled design review meeting. The meeting does not shorten
the 14 day window, votes still count only as GitHub reviews on the pull request, and
decisions or objections from the meeting are written into the PMEP within a week.

A substantive change to an *Accepted* PMEP reopens a 7 day window and needs 1 approval.
Editorial changes need none.

## What a PMEP must contain

In this order:

- **TL;DR** (at most 150 words)
- **What it looks like** (code, before and after)
- **Resulting signatures** (written out, with schema versions for file formats)
- Motivation
- Specification
- Rationale, including rejected alternatives
- Backwards compatibility (deprecation version, expected removal version)
- Implementation

This structure is for Standards PMEPs. Process PMEPs adapt it and keep what applies.

The first three are mandatory before voting opens. A reviewer should be able to form a view in
five minutes from them alone. `docs/source/pmep/TEMPLATE.md` has them stubbed.

## Relationship to issues and PRs

A PMEP specifies. Issues carry it out and link back. PRs implementing an accepted PMEP cite it,
and may be declined for diverging from it without reopening the design. If implementation shows
the spec is wrong, the PMEP is revised.

## Adoption

This PMEP is adopted under its own rule: 14 days, 2 approvals from active core contributors
other than the author(s), no unresolved objection. The initial core contributor list in
`GOVERNANCE.md` is accepted with it.
